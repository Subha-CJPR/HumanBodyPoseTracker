By using Basics.py, we are testing that the camera is capable of taking
image / video or not. Afterwards, implementing PoseModule.py,
we can select any part from 33 parts of our body.

And finally. TestProject.py is the main file where we can successfully 
run that application. Hope that it helped you all!
